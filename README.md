# Teatr
This is an Electron application that manages my movies in my hard disks. It has these features:

1. Reads movie folders and finds movie information from imdb.
2. Helps user to filter and search in his/her movies.

## Technologies
The application has been written initially with C# Winforms. Actually this project is my laboratory to test new frameworks and technologies. Code of some of these technolgies are in other branches. The main one I am using now are:
* Github Electron
* NodeJS
* Aurelia
* Typescript

You can found code written in these technolgies in v0.1 branch:
* ASP.NET 5 (vNext)
* WinForms

## Running the App
Install NodeJS then install the following packages using npm:
```
npm install -g typescript
npm install -g electron-prebuilt
npm install -g jspm
npm install
jspm install
```
